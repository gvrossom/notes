Here, ants are creators, contributors, writers, reviewers, but most importantly, we are teachers and learners.

Here any member of the colony can set up its own objectives, develop its own ideas 
and rely on others to help in the process.

## Ants Documentation

What you are currently reading.

* Serves as online support for our courses and projects.
* Contains a guide to self-teaching programmers, currently in the "/docs/courses" section, [here](./course/programming). 
It will be moved to a section on its own; "/docs/programming".

> In our lab, we collect, create, break and rebuild objects, electronics and computers, 
with one goal in mind; have fun.

We want to make these stuffs available and accessible to anyone.
