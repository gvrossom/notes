Ants among Hills:

**Field ants**, also known by their genus name as Formica ants, build nest mounds in open areas. 
They may join to create supercolonies with hundreds of millions of ant workers spread across thousands of miles.

**Leafcutter Ants**, or fungus gardening ants, were agricultural experts long before man planted seeds in the ground. 
The leafcutter workers snip off pieces of plant material and carry the leaf bits back to their underground nest. 
The ants then chew the leaves, and use the partially digested leaf bits as a substrate on which to grow fungus, on which they feed. 
Leafcutter ants even use antibiotics, produced from strains of Streptomyces bacteria, to inhibit the growth of unwanted fungi. 
When a queen begins a new colony, she brings a starter culture of fungus with her to the new nest site.

**Acacia Ants**, Acacia ants are so named for their symbiotic relationship with acacia trees. 
They live within hollow thorns of the tree, and feed at special nectaries at the base its leaves. 
In exchange for this food and shelter, the acacia ants will vigorously defend their host tree from herbivores.

**Weaver Ants**, Weaver ants construct sophisticated nests in the treetops by sewing leaves together. 
Workers begin by using their jaws to pull the edges of a pliable leaf together. 
Other workers then carry larvae to the construction site, and give them a tender squeeze with their mandibles. 
This makes the larvae exude a silken thread, which the workers can use to affix the leaves together. Over time, the nest might jo
