This wiki serves as a virtual support and documentation for our [[courses]].  
Contributors can head to the [How-to?](howto) section for more in depth information on how to, well, contribute. 
Whether it is robotics, programming, engineering or science, documentation is a must-write and -read.  
To know more about the project: read the [[Ants]] page.  
Feedbacks, question? Right [this way](/#contact).

To discover what is a wiki and why use one, go to the [[wiki]] section of this wiki, how funny!  
Finally, there is a [[demo]] page for people who want to see how the website works.
