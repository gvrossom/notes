This wiki serves as a virtual support and documentation for our [[courses]].  
Whether it is robotics, programming, engineering or science, documentation is a must-write and -read.

Here is a [[demo]] page for demo users to see how the app works.

## What is a wiki and why use one?

Here is the definition from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org){:target="_blank"}, the largest wiki engine in world.

> A Wiki is a website that provides collaborative modification of its content and structure directly from the web browser.
<small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) - Collected on March 6th, 2017.</small>

Practically speaking, a wiki engine is a system of pages (like a book) organized as a tree.  
As it is virtual, there is no limit to the amount of pages we can create.

One of the particularity of the web is that it is a collection of pages linked to each other. 
That is quite powerful in a wiki. That means that we can relate different topics or subjects together. 
In order to link pages together, we need two things; the link to the page we want to relate it to, and, 
a markup language. The markup will help the computer behind this website to recognize the link, and, 
to render it as a button on the page.

The first thing you'll need is a MarkUp language. [What is a markup language?]  
Two markup languages are available on this website: [ReStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html){:target="_blank"} 
and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown){:target="_blank"}.

[It helps humans write content by taking away the formating of the document, 
allowing the user to focus on the text. You will find it very handy to include code or mathematic functions in your text.]


We recommend starting with the lighter of the two: Markdown, that you can learn [here](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/){:target="_blank"}.  
It takes 15 minutes to learn, and it is pretty awesome!
 


Head to the [How-to?](howto) section for more in depth information on how to contribute.

```
This pages need content, help me write it!
