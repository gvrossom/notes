##Objective
test link with simple program downloaded into robot

##Program

- Open EV3 software
- Action (green) components: 
- add: component Display 
- set Text - Pixels, type "Hello World" in text box
- component Sound and component Brick Status can also be tagged in sequence
- optional: select file for sound or image
- Save project as RoverL1Ex1
- Download program to robot Rover
- Play
- Note results

##Interface of EV3 software primer
- open new project by clicking on tab + (upper right beside the wrench icon)
- white space is where component blocks  are attached together to write program
- first component is the START block (with green triangular arrow), this must be your first block
- bottom tabs hold the component blocks into functional groups
- green tab contain ACTION blocks, orange tab contain FLOW CONTROL blocks
- yellow tab contain SENSOR blocks, red tab contain DATA OPERATIONS blocks

## What is a programming block?
- In a visual programming software like EV3, 
a block holds pre-compiled command scripts that can be parameterised to react to context variables
In other words, a block contains code that will do a specific task/action when executed during a program
run and this code will read externalised variables that will affect the action

- we call it a component because the code can run in an autonomous fashion, 
with pre-determined inputs and outputs
