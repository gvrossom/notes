### Back to [[root]] / [[courses]] / Welcome on Electronics 101 <small>Based on [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/){:target="_blank"}
<hr>

This course is an eight hours program consisting in understanding the basics and 
getting hands on electronic circuits. 
There is an introduction to programming as well as a master/final project to build, 
to show off a little bit but most importantly to see how everything fits together.


## In this course we will discover

* Basic electrical theory
* How a breadboard works
* Series and parralel circuits
* the Arduino pins and the Arduino language
* How to use sensors
* How to control motors and servomotors

## Course lessons

* Lesson 1: Review the basics of electricity and [Get to know your tools](./electronics/get-to-know-the-tools) - 60 minutes - Level 1 
* Lesson 2: Discover the [digital pins of the Arduino](./electronics/arduinos-digital-pins), 
the [analog pins of the Arduino](./electronics/arduinos-analog-pins), 
and the [Pulse Width Modulation](./electronics/pulse-width-modulation) - 3 * 45 minutes - Level 1 
* Lesson 3: [Controlling servomotors](./electronics/controlling-servos) - 60 min - Level 2 
* Lesson 4: [Controlling motors](./electronics/controlling-motors) - 45 min - Level 3 


## Tools required for this course:
