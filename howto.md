## How to wiki?

To include special characters, such as this one: &para;, in your pages, 
you can directly inject the html code. In this case: `&para;`.

Have a look [here](http://www.symbole-clavier.com/){:target="_blank"}


To create links within the doc, you can use relative path with a dod `.` as 
parent folder.

Here's an example in markdown: 

```
Go to [courses](./courses)
```

Which turns into: 

> Go to [courses](./courses)
