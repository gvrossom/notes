Feed back from first lesson (March 6th, 2017)

* Defintion and understanding of what is a robot is unclear.

We could ask before or after each lesson to see how it adds up.

* Understanding of the functioning of the wiki will take more time so the process should be simplified.

We can create one "course" page and the children must work together to write it. 
One group would be in charge of that page. 
Then, list the specific topics met during the class, and, create a page for each topic. 
Each topic page will be maintained by two children working as a pair.

That leaves us with 4 pages in total and three topics to be defined by the children themselves.

Ideas for topics:

* Robotics: the hardware and the software.
* what is the least you need to create a robot? Electricity, Power, a circuit (wires), electric components.
* what is a PCB?
* Electricity and movement.


Crit√®res:

Comprehension, motivation, sondage de satisfaction de comprehension
